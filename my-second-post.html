                In June 2024, AI music platforms <strong>Suno and Udio</strong> faced federal lawsuits from the three titans of the industry: 
                Universal Music Group (UMG), Warner Music Group (WMG), and Sony Music Entertainment. 
                The allegation? Massive copyright infringement through unauthorized use of recordings for AI training.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast-forward to today, and a pattern has emerged. WMG and UMG have settled with Udio and Suno (late 2025), 
                effectively moving from litigation to <strong>partnership</strong>.

            <h2>The Two-Tier Licensing Model</h2>
            <p>
                By initially operating without licenses, these companies gained millions of users and developed advanced tech. 
                Now, they are selectively settling only with the players who have the legal power to stop them.

                    <strong>Independent Artists:</strong> Comprising 46.7% of the market, they are left with no choice to opt out, 
                    no recognition, and zero compensation.

                This isn't just a legal victory for labels; it’s a systemic problem. These settlements allow AI companies 
                to continue profiting from past infringement while the independent creators—often the backbone of 
                originality—remain vulnerable.
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>
                "The problem is that these settlements encourage companies to use copyrighted material without 
                consent, counting on the fact that they can simply pay a 'settlement fee' once they’ve already 
                become indispensable."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                As fair use laws expand, there is a real risk that creative work can be copied without penalty 
                as long as the AI company is "too big to sue."
