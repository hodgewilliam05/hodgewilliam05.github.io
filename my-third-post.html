        <section class="intro">
            <p>The intersection of <strong>Generative AI</strong> and music has moved from a technical curiosity to a high-stakes legal battlefield. As we enter 2026, the question is no longer just "Can AI make music?" but rather "Who owns the data that taught it how to sing?"</p>

            <h2>The Training Data Debate</h2>
            <p>At the heart of most lawsuits is the process of <strong>ingestion</strong>. AI models like Suno and Udio are trained on millions of songs to learn patterns, melodies, and vocal textures. Major labels (Universal, Sony, Warner) argue this is <strong>mass copyright infringement</strong>, while AI developers often claim <strong>Fair Use</strong>.</p>
            
            
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Labels' Stance:</strong> Training is unauthorized reproduction of protected works.</li>
                <li><strong>The AI Developers' Stance:</strong> The process is "transformative," creating new works rather than copying originals.</li>

            <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
            <p>The U.S. Copyright Office continues to maintain that <strong>purely AI-generated music cannot be copyrighted</strong>. However, the industry is shifting toward "opt-in" models where artists are compensated for their participation in training sets. 2026 will likely be the year we see the first definitive rulings on whether "algorithmic inspiration" counts as theft.</p>
