            <p>The honeymoon phase of "AI covers" is officially over. As we enter February 2026, the music industry has moved from curiosity to high-stakes litigation. We are no longer debating <em>if</em> AI can infringe on music, but rather how many billions that infringement is worth.</p>

            <h2>Breaking: The $3 Billion Anthropic Lawsuit</h2>
            <p>In one of the most significant escalations to date, a coalition of major publishers including <strong>Universal Music</strong> and <strong>Concord</strong> filed a massive lawsuit against Anthropic on January 28, 2026. They are seeking over <strong>$3 billion</strong> in statutory damages.</p>
            
            

            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Allegation:</strong> Anthropic allegedly "torrented" millions of pirated books and songbooks to train its Claude models.</li>
                <li><strong>The Evidence:</strong> Publishers claim the AI can be "jailbroken" to output copyrighted lyrics for over 20,000 protected songs.</li>

            <h2>From Courts to Contracts: The Rise of Licensing</h2>
            <p>While some are suing, others are settling. A new trend has emerged in 2026: the <strong>"Licensed AI"</strong> model. Companies like <strong>Suno</strong> and <strong>Udio</strong> have recently settled with major labels to launch "fully authorized" subscription services.</p>
