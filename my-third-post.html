        <section class="intro">
            <p>For years, the "Wild West" of generative AI operated with little oversight, scraping decades of musical history to train algorithms. In 2026, the law is finally catching up. From new federal bills to landmark state protections, the government is moving to ensure that <strong>human creators</strong> remain at the center of the music economy.</p>

            <h2>Federal Breakthrough: The TRAIN Act of 2026</h2>
            <p>Introduced just last month, the <strong>Transparency and Responsibility for Artificial Intelligence Networks (TRAIN) Act</strong> is a game-changer. It aims to force AI developers to pull back the curtain on their datasets.</p>
            
            

            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Transparency Mandate:</strong> Requires AI companies to maintain and provide access to training records, allowing artists to see if their work was used without consent.</li>
                <li><strong>Recourse for Artists:</strong> Creates a formal mechanism for copyright holders to seek compensation or demand the removal of their data from future model updates.</li>

            <p>While federal laws move slowly, states are taking immediate action to protect "voice and likeness"—the two most vulnerable parts of an artist's brand in the AI era.</p>

            <p>Across the Atlantic, the <strong>EU AI Act</strong> is entering its final enforcement phase. By August 2026, AI music platforms must provide machine-readable "reservations of rights" that respect an artist's choice to opt out of training entirely.</p>
